# Apache HTTP Server Setup on Windows (Using Variables in `httpd.conf`)

This guide explains how to properly configure the `ServerRoot` directive using a variable in Apache HTTP Server on Windows.

---

## 📁 1. Ensure Correct Directory Structure

Make sure you have extracted the Apache files correctly. The expected path is:

```
C:\Apache24\
```

---

## ✏️ 2. Edit the `httpd.conf` File

**Location:**  
```
C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf
```

Add the following lines at the top of the file to define the `SRVROOT` variable and configure the `ServerRoot`:

```apache
Define SRVROOT "C:/Apache24"
ServerRoot "${SRVROOT}"
```

---

## 🌐 3. Set the `ServerName` Directive

To suppress warnings about the server’s fully qualified domain name (FQDN), add this line **after** the `ServerRoot` directive:

```apache
ServerName localhost:80
```

---

## 🔁 4. Change the Listening Port (Optional)

If port 80 is occupied by another application (e.g., IIS or Skype), change the listening port:

```apache
Listen 8080
```

Also update the `ServerName` directive:

```apache
ServerName localhost:8080
```

---

## 🔐 5. Check Directory Permissions

Ensure the Apache service has permission to access the directory:
```
C:\Apache24
```

> 🛡️ Tip: Run Command Prompt as Administrator when starting Apache.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Install Apache as a Windows Service

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the Apache `bin` directory:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Apache24\bin
   ```
3. Install Apache as a service:
   ```cmd
   httpd.exe -k install
   ```

---

## ▶️ 7. Start Apache from Command Prompt

You can start the Apache service using:
```cmd
httpd.exe -k start
```

---

## 🖥️ 8. Start Apache from Windows Services

1. Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
2. In the **Services** window, locate `Apache2.4`.
3. Right-click and select **Start**.

---

## 🛠️ 9. Troubleshooting Tips

- Make sure **no other application** is using the same port (e.g., Skype, IIS).
- Disable or reconfigure conflicting software.
- Ensure **firewall settings** allow Apache traffic.
- Check `error.log` in `C:\Apache24\logs` for detailed error messages.

---

## ✅ Final Check

Visit the following URL in your browser to confirm Apache is running:

- If using port 80: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- If using port 8080: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

---

📌 **Note:** Always restart Apache after making changes to `httpd.conf`.

Happy hosting! 🎉
